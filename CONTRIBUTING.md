### Creating Personal Access Token (PAT)
To publish this library to github, you need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub. Please follow the instructions below:
- On github, create a Token (classic), for information on this please see https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
- Grant the following permissions to your PAT: **read:packages**, **write:packages**, and **repo**
- Save the token in a safe place, i.e. 1Password.
- Finally, authorize BottleRocketStudios to use your PAT.

### Specify user name and token as Shell Environment Variables

```
export REPO_READ_WRITE_USER=<<Your Github Username or Email Address>>
export REPO_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=<<Your PAT>>
```
